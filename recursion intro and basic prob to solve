you break down bigger prob into smaller prob ..now all these smaller probs combinedly will help you to solve the bigger prob...
two things are important in recursion
1.base case
2.recursive case----will help you to get the small answer
1.factorial
2.fibanocci
3.count digits
4.increasing to decreasing and vice versa
5.given an array,you need to tell weather the array is sorted or not in recursion
